## üéØ Critical Features Successfully Extracted

### 1. Bot Names Changed to Personalized Names ‚úÖ FOUND
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-19T01:41:36.799Z

**Main.js Change**:
```javascript
// OLD:
getBotDifficultyText() {
  const difficulties = {
    0: 'Random',
    1: 'Easy',
    2: 'Medium',
    3: 'Hard',
    4: 'Expert'
  };
  return difficulties[this.botDifficulty] || 'Easy';
}

// NEW:
getBotDifficultyText() {
  const difficulties = {
    0: 'Random',
    1: 'Eric',
    2: 'Emmy',
    3: 'Asa',
    4: 'Bayes'
  };
  return difficulties[this.botDifficulty] || 'Eric';
}
```

**HTML Changes** (2025-09-19T01:41:28.706Z):
- Easy ‚Üí Eric (Easy)
- Medium ‚Üí Emmy (Medium)
- Hard ‚Üí Asa (Hard)
- Expert ‚Üí Bayes (Expert) + made default selected

### 2. Save/Restore Game State Implementation ‚úÖ FOUND
**Multiple patches** implementing comprehensive save/restore with cookies:
- `saveGameState()` and `loadGameState()` functions
- Cookie-based persistence for Rabbit R1 compatibility
- Auto-save functionality after moves
- State validation and recovery

### 3. Bot Move Fixes ‚úÖ FOUND
**4 patches** addressing bot move failures:
- Enhanced bot initialization for different scenarios
- Fixed async/await issues in bot move generation
- Improved error handling for bot operations

### 4. Back to Game Button Intelligence ‚úÖ FOUND
**3 patches** implementing smart "Back to game" functionality:
- Context-aware button behavior
- Improved menu state management

### 5. Bot Difficulty Change Detection ‚úÖ FOUND
**5 patches** implementing difficulty tracking:
- Enhanced difficulty selection handling
- State persistence for difficulty settings

### 6. UI Improvements ‚úÖ FOUND
- Orange spinner removal
- CSS styling updates
- Enhanced move commentary with capture details

## üìã Verification Status

### Applied Patches: 9/78 (11.5%)
**Successfully applied patches** already in current code:
- Basic game initialization
- Some UI improvements
- Partial state management

### Missing Patches: 31/78 (39.7%)
**Critical missing functionality** includes:
- **Bot names personalization** (Eric, Emmy, Asa, Bayes)
- Complete save/restore implementation
- Enhanced bot move handling
- Auto-save functionality
- Advanced state management

### Partial Patches: 12/78 (15.4%)
**Partially applied** - need investigation:
- Mixed old/new code patterns suggest incomplete implementations

### Unknown Status: 26/78 (33.3%)
**Require manual inspection** to determine status

## üö® Priority Recovery Items

### 1. CRITICAL: Bot Names Personalization
The most distinctive feature - changing from generic difficulty names to personalized bot names (Eric, Emmy, Asa, Bayes). This is **missing** from current code.

### 2. HIGH: Complete Save/Restore System
Comprehensive game state persistence for Rabbit R1 device. **Partially implemented**.

### 3. HIGH: Enhanced Bot AI
Improved bot move generation and failure handling. **Mostly missing**.

### 4. MEDIUM: UI Polish
Smart menu behavior and enhanced move descriptions. **Partially applied**.

## üîç Technical Details

### Extraction Method
- Parsed Claude session logs (JSONL format)
- Identified `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, and `Write` tool operations
- Extracted exact before/after code changes
- Matched against target feature patterns
- Cross-referenced with current codebase

### Confidence Level: 56.7%
Based on successful pattern matching and code verification against current main.js (180,206 characters).

## üìÅ Files Generated
