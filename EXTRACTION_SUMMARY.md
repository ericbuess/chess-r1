## Technical Improvements
- State management for mid-game setting changes

## Files Generated
- **77 individual patch files**: `/Users/ericbuess/Projects/chess-r1/patches/patch_001.txt` through `patch_077.txt`
- **Index file**: `/Users/ericbuess/Projects/chess-r1/patches/patch_index.md`
- **This summary**: `/Users/ericbuess/Projects/chess-r1/EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md`

## Missing Elements
**Note**: The user mentioned looking for "Ella (Easiest), Evy (Medium), Emmy (Hard), Asa (Hardest)" labels. These specific parenthetical difficulty descriptions appear to be added in patches that occurred after our 12 PM cutoff on September 19th. The extracted patches show the bot name changes but not the parenthetical difficulty descriptions.

## Verification
- ✅ All patches are before major system issues
- ✅ Key bot name evolution captured (Eric → Ella, etc.)
- ✅ New game requirement logic included
- ✅ Bot difficulty change detection implemented
- ⚠️ Parenthetical difficulty labels (Easiest, Medium, Hard, Hardest) likely in later patches

## Usage
Each patch file contains:
- Timestamp and source reference
- Complete old/new string comparison
- Replace-all flag status
- Context from MultiEdit operations where applicable

The patches can be applied sequentially to understand the evolution of the chess application's bot system and difficulty management features.
