# Chess R1 - Development Plan

## ✅ ALL MAJOR FEATURES WORKING

### Completed & Verified
- [x] ✅ Bot names: Eric, Emmy, Asa, Bayes
- [x] ✅ Orange spinner when bot thinking
- [x] ✅ Button state tracking - all scenarios working
- [x] ✅ Bot plays first when human is black
- [x] ✅ **SAVE/RESTORE WORKING** - Game state persists across refresh!

### The Cookie Issue Solution
**Problem**: Game state was 7-14KB, exceeding browser's 4KB cookie limit
**Solution**: Automatically fallback to localStorage for large data
- Small data (last_game_mode): Uses cookies
- Large data (game state): Uses localStorage
- Fallback chain: creationStorage → cookies/localStorage → localStorage

## 🎉 Status
The Chess R1 app is fully functional with all critical features restored from the lost patches. Save/restore, button states, bot names, and all UI features are working correctly.

## 📝 Lessons Learned
1. Always check data size when using cookies (4KB limit)
2. Use localStorage for large data structures
3. Test with actual browser (Puppeteer) to verify functionality
4. Apply patches exactly as extracted - don't reinvent solutions
