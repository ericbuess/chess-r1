# Chess R1 - Development Plan

## âœ… Completed Features (Verified Working)
- [x] âœ… Bot names: Eric, Emmy, Asa, Bayes (NOT Ella/Evy)
- [x] âœ… Orange spinner when bot thinking (inline, 3vw)
- [x] âœ… Button state tracking - all scenarios working
- [x] âœ… Bot plays first when human is black
- [x] âœ… Color change mid-game disables button
- [x] âœ… Difficulty change mid-game disables button

## ðŸ”§ Current Issue - Save/Restore Not Fully Working

### Problem
The critical missing piece was `loadGameState()` never being called on initialization. The subagent found that cookies and storage were working, but the game never attempted to load saved state on startup.

### The Fix Needed
Add this missing initialization in DOMContentLoaded:
```javascript
const loaded = await gameUI.loadGameState();
if (loaded) {
  console.log('Game restored from saved state');
} else {
  console.log('Starting fresh game - no saved state found');
}
```

### To Verify
- [ ] Game state persists after refresh
- [ ] Move history restores
- [ ] Game mode (human vs bot/human) restores
- [ ] Board orientation restores
- [ ] Sound settings restore
- [ ] Player colors restore

## ðŸ“Š Storage Implementation Status
- Cookie functions: âœ… Working correctly
- Storage chain: creationStorage â†’ cookies â†’ localStorage âœ…
- Keys used:
  - `chess_game_state_human_vs_bot`
  - `chess_game_state_human_vs_human`
  - `last_game_mode`

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Done
- Removed all patch recovery files
- Moved tests to tests/ directory
- Removed node_modules from git
- Added .gitignore
