# Chess R1 - Development Plan

## ‚úÖ ALL MAJOR FEATURES WORKING

### Completed & Verified
- [x] ‚úÖ Bot names: Ella (Easy), Evy (Normal), Emmy (Hard), Asa (Hardest)
- [x] ‚úÖ Orange spinner when bot thinking
- [x] ‚úÖ Button state tracking - all scenarios working
- [x] ‚úÖ Bot plays first when human is black
- [x] ‚úÖ **SAVE/RESTORE WORKING** - Game state persists across refresh!
- [x] ‚úÖ **UNDO/REDO FIXED** - No more crashes with null engineState
- [x] ‚úÖ **AUTO-SAVE WORKING** - State saves after every move

### The Cookie Issue Solution
**Problem**: Game state was 7-14KB, exceeding browser's 4KB cookie limit
**Solution**: Automatically fallback to localStorage for large data
- Small data (last_game_mode): Uses cookies
- Large data (game state): Uses localStorage
- Fallback chain: creationStorage ‚Üí cookies/localStorage ‚Üí localStorage

## üéâ Status
The Chess R1 app is fully functional with all critical features restored from the lost patches. Save/restore, button states, bot names, and all UI features are working correctly.

## üîß Recent Fixes (Sep 19, 2025)

### Fixed Issues
1. **Undo/Redo crash** - Added `reconstructEngineState()` method to rebuild state from moves when engineState is null
2. **Auto-save missing** - Added `autoSave()` call to `recordGameState()` so state persists after each move
3. **Mode switching logic** - Added `originalGameMode` tracking to distinguish mode switches from setting changes
4. **engineState bloat** - Set engineState to null for moves (only kept for initial state), reducing size from ~14KB to ~4.5KB

### Current Behavior
- **Mode Switching**: Each game mode (human-vs-bot, human-vs-human) maintains its own separate game state
- **State Size**: Currently ~4.5KB (slightly over 4KB cookie limit, uses localStorage fallback)
- **Undo/Redo**: Works by reconstructing engine state from moves when needed

## üìù Lessons Learned
1. Always check data size when using cookies (4KB limit)
2. Use localStorage for large data structures
3. Test with actual browser (Puppeteer) to verify functionality
4. Apply patches exactly as extracted - don't reinvent solutions
5. Missing auto-save can make it seem like features aren't working
6. Null checks are critical when optimizing storage
